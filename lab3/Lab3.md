min is about 0.4v  - bulb requires some power to heat up so doesn't output light until about 0.4v

max is 1.68v  
Why does it plateau? The circuit cannot recieve higher voltages, so it caps out at around 1.68v

???Missing characteristic img???  
Curve is exponential as p= V^2/R  
Why does it oscillate? The circuit is made up of 4 op amps which create a simulated second order ODE.  

linear at 1.45-1.55v  
if it was fully linear it would look like a straight line graph  
the gradient gives the gain of the system.

assumes signal is in asteady state (continuous and constant sinousoidal wave) 
Peaks at 5hz which is the frequency of ODE oscillation:

Manual Calculation using G(s):  
Starts at (0,0)  
5Hz -> 12.2dB  
20Hz -> -37.1743dB

Also peaks at 5Hz at 12dB higher gain, which correlates to multiplier from lightbulb characteristic graph gain in 1.45-1.55v range. (gradient of ???)     
???Graph showing higher gain???  
  
Task 4 Measure the Step Response of the Bulb Board    
Captures the transient response instead of steady state:  
As before, the response oscillates at 5Hz  
Step up has a higher amplitude of oscillation as it is in high gain range of lightbulb characteristic  
Step down has lower gain, so lower amplitude can be seen:

???show a graph of working out the gradients???
