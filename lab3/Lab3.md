Task 1  
1.5v ->1.74 v  
0v -> 0.02  
min iis about 0.4v  
max is 1.68v  


Curve is exponential as p= V^2/R  
Why does it plateau?  
Why does it oscillate?

linear at 1.45-1.55v  
if it was linear it would look like a straight line graph  


Task 2  
Peaks at 5hz  
Starts at (0,0)  
5Hz 12.2  
20Hz -37.1743  
21.1933  


Task 3  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/147e39f5-a88d-4db8-967f-55698d20bcb5)
Also peaks at 5Hz  
But goes lower at 9Hz  

It oscillated because it simulates a second order device  
Task 4 ???
