Task 1  
Step 1:

Successfully connected the pybench, and accessed the files

Step 2:

Checked and all test features worked fine  

Step 3:  
Matlab path setup worked, and pb returned expected properties

Task 2:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/955c021d-d563-45f8-8e96-ddcd4d925d60)
pb changes the properties of the output signal sine wave,  
plot('o') plots just the sample points on figure 1,  
plot() does a continous wave  
and figure 2 shows frequency domain  

Task 3:  
The first code produces a single instant of the noise put into the microphone, and its frequency spectrum  
when the loop is added the file continuosly updates, and when the input frequency is increased it goes up on the frequency spectrum  

task 4:  
1000

hamming  

makes the peak sharper by multiplying the frequency we want by a hamming window:
